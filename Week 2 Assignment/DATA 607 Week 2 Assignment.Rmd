## Week 2

Choose six recent popular movies. Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends) to rate each of these movie that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. Take the results (observations) and store them in a SQL database. Load the information into an R dataframe.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
movie_reviews <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jennier2015/DATA-607/master/Week%202%20Assignment/movie_review.csv")
movie_reviews <- as.data.frame(movie_reviews)
movie_reviews <- as.data.frame(movie_reviews)
is.data.frame(movie_reviews)
head(movie_reviews)
```
